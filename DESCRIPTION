Description: PhILR is short for Phylogenetic Isometric Log-Ratio Transform.
 This package provides functions for the analysis of compositional
 data (e.g., data representing proportions of different variables/parts).
 Specifically this package allows analysis of compositional data where the parts
 can be related through a phylogenetic tree  (as is common in microbiota survey
 data) and makes available the Isometric Log Ratio transform built from the
 phylogenetic tree and utilizing a weighted reference measure.
